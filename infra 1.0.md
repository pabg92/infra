```bash
terraform init
```
#### Examples of Terraform Configurations
Here’s an example of using Terraform to manage resources, including setting up CyberPanel and Jenkins.
1. **Create a `main.tf` File**:
```hcl
provider "hetznercloud" {
token = var.hcloud_token
}
resource "hcloud_server" "cyberpanel" {
name = "cyberpanel-server"
image = "ubuntu-22.04"
server_type = "cpx31"
ssh_keys = ["${var.ssh_key_name}"]
}
resource "hcloud_server" "jenkins" {
name = "jenkins-server"
image = "ubuntu-22.04"
server_type = "cpx31"
ssh_keys = ["${var.ssh_key_name}"]
}
```
2. **Create a `variables.tf` File**:
```hcl
variable "hcloud_token" {}
variable "ssh_key_name" {}
```
3. **Create a `terraform.tfvars` File**:
```hcl
hcloud_token = "YOUR_HCLOUD_API_TOKEN"
ssh_key_name = "YOUR_SSH_KEY_NAME"
```
4. **Apply the Configuration**:
```bash
terraform plan
terraform apply
```
#### Best Practices for Version Control and Managing Terraform State
- **Use a Remote Backend** for Terraform state, such as **HashiCorp Consul** or **S3 with locks**.
- **Version Control** your Terraform configurations using Git.
- **Use Modules** to organize configurations.
### Ansible for Configuration Management
#### Installing and Configuring Ansible
1. **Install Ansible**:
```bash

sudo apt install -y ansible
```
2. **Verify Installation**:
```bash
ansible --version
```
#### Creating Ansible Playbooks
1. **Create a Directory for Playbooks**:
```bash
mkdir ~/ansible-playbooks && cd ~/ansible-playbooks
```
2. **Example: Ansible Playbook to Install Docker on Multiple Machines**:
```yaml
# docker-install.yaml
- hosts: all
become: yes
tasks:
- name: Install prerequisites
apt:
name: ['apt-transport-https', 'ca-certificates', 'curl', 'gnupg-agent', 'software-properties-common']
state: present
- name: Add Docker’s official GPG key
apt_key:
url: https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg

apt_repository:
repo: deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu focal stable
state: present
- name: Update apt and install Docker
apt:
name: ['docker-ce', 'docker-ce-cli', 'containerd.io']
state: present
update_cache: yes
```
3. **Run the Playbook**:
```bash
ansible-playbook -i hosts docker-install.yaml
```
#### Integrating Ansible with Terraform
- **Output Inventory from Terraform**:
- Modify your `main.tf` to output IP addresses.
```hcl
output "server_ips" {
value = [hcloud_server.cyberpanel.ipv4_address, hcloud_server.jenkins.ipv4_address]
}
```
- **Use Terraform Dynamic Inventory**:
- Install `terraform-inventory` or use Terraform's built-in capabilities to generate an Ansible inventory.
- **Run Ansible Against Terraform-Provisioned Hosts**:
- Fetch the inventory and run playbooks accordingly.
### Demonstrating How Terraform and Ansible Work Together
- **Provision with Terraform**: Create infrastructure.
- **Configure with Ansible**: Install software and configure services.
- **Automate the Workflow**: Use scripts or CI pipelines to chain Terraform and Ansible.
